# TODO: Improve ListingDetails Page CSS

## Tasks
- [x] Enhance the .button class: Improve padding, font size, ensure full width on mobile, add better hover/focus states, and make it more consistent.
- [x] Add styles for additional buttons (e.g., delete button) to avoid inline styles.
- [x] Refine the .booking section: Ensure proper spacing, alignment, and responsiveness for the DateRange and button.
- [x] Improve general layout: Adjust margins, ensure text colors are readable, and add any missing styles for elements like the title or photos grid.
- [x] Test the changes by running the frontend app to verify button appearance and layout.
